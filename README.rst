When I was a kid, my dad found his favorite old Atari game on floppy disk. One
of my first memories is of learning (and being taught how) to play this game.

Now I'm gonna attempt to build software that learns to play this game. I'll
consider the AI a success when it can consistently beat dad's scores.
